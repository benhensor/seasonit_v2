### SeasonIt v2.0

Welcome to the repository for SeasonIt v2.0.

SeasonIt was originally conceived during a hackathon as part of a team effort to build a 'Product feature on the theme of sustainability'.

The idea was to create a seasonal produce tracker that allows users to check what fresh foods are currently in season in the UK throughout the calendar year.

I thought the idea was a good way to continue learning with React and so I built SeasonIt v1.0. 

The original app was purely a frontend project built entirely in React, making use of custom context hooks for managing persistent state changes.

Version 2 is a full stack MERN application built using a React JS frontend, Node Express server and a MongoDB database. The dummy data is still the same as in v1 but this time data is retreived from Mongo via CRUD routes making for a more robust application. 

## Deployment

The frontend is still under construction.
